Objectives
Your program should process the user requests. In this stage, your program should:

Welcome users;
Display the instructions;
Ask for a request;
If a user enters an empty request, print the instructions;
If the user enters zero, terminate the program;
If numbers are not natural, print the error message;
If an incorrect property is specified, print the error message and the list of available properties;
For one number, print the properties of the number;
For two numbers, print the properties of all numbers in the list;
For two numbers and two properties, print the list of numbers that contain the specified properties;
If a property is preceded by a minus, this property should not be present in a number;
If the user specifies mutually exclusive properties, abort the request and warn the user.
Once the request is processed, continue execution from step 3.

In this stage, property names include even, odd, buzz, duck, palindromic, gapful, spy, sunny, square,
jumping, sad, and happy. Mutually exclusive properties are even/odd, duck/spy, sunny/square, sad/happy
pairs, as well as direct opposites (property and -property).

Properties of numbers:

- buzz number:
"They are numbers that are either divisible by 7 or end with 7. For example, the number 14 is a buzz number, since it is divisible
by 7 without a remainder; the number 17 ends with 7, so it is also a buzz number. However, the number 75 is not a Buzz number,
since it is neither divisible by 7 nor does it end with 7. The number 7 is a Buzz number too."

- duck number:
"A Duck number is a positive number that contains zeroes. For example, 3210, 8050896, 70709 are Duck numbers. Note that a number
with a leading 0 is not a Duck number. So, numbers like 035 or 0212 are not Duck numbers. Although, 01203 is a Duck, since it
has a trailing 0."

- palindromic number:
"A Palindromic number is symmetrical; in other words, it stays the same regardless of whether we read it from left or right. For
example, 17371 is a palindromic number. 5 is also a palindromic number. 1234 is not. If read it from right, it becomes 4321."

- gapful number:
"It is a number that contains at least 3 digits and is divisible by the concatenation of its first and last digit without
a remainder. 12 is not a Gapful number, as it has only two digits. 132 is a Gapful number, as 132 % 12 == 0. Another good
example of a Gapful number is 7881, as 7881 % 71 == 0."

- spy number:
"A number is said to be Spy if the sum of all digits is equal to the product of all digits."

- sunny number:
"N is a sunny number if N+1 is a perfect square number. In mathematics, a square number or a perfect square is an integer
that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of an integer with itself. For example, 9 is a square
number, since it equals 32 and can be written as 3Ã—3."

- jumping number:
"A number is a Jumping number if the adjacent digits inside the number differ by 1. The difference between 9 and 0 is not
considered as 1. Single-digit numbers are considered Jumping numbers. For example, 78987, and 4343456 are Jumping numbers,
but 796 and 89098 are not."

- happy/sad number:
"In number theory, a happy number is a number that reaches 1 after a sequence during which the number is replaced by the
sum of each digit squares. For example, 13 is a happy number, as 12 + 32 = 10 which leads to 12 + 02 = 1. On the other
hand, 4 is not a happy number because the sequence starts with 42 = 16, 12 + 62 = 37, and finally reaches 22 + 02 = 4.
This is the number that started the sequence, so the process goes on in an infinite cycle. A number that is not happy
is called Sad (or Unhappy)."
